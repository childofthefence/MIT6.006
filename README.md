# MIT6.006
Introduction to Algorithms from the Fall 2011 lectures found at https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/

These are just my hand written notes in case some of you don't want to write them all out.  It's mostly what's on the boards except for some additional notes here and there.  Also a good study tool if you don't want to watch the entire lectures.

I know my handwriting isn't the best, but I'm working on it.
